# temporal_spatial



## Requirements

This repository contains two simple projects, one in Python that generates fake data in CSV format, and another in Java that emulates an ETL process.

1. Run the Python script and generate a file with 500 thousand lines. Remember to install the dependencies.

> pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the Java project and process the file generated by the Python script.

3. Measure the temporal and spatial complexity of the two scripts on three different machines.

4. Calculate the speedup of the two best results after execution on different machines.

5. Create the report with the graphs and explanation of the obtained results. Don't forget to include the formulas for the resulting complexity and their respective simplification.



> Note: Run the scripts a minimum of 3 times per machine and report all the results in tables

> Speedup = Tiempo en la version mejorada / Tiempo en la version anterior
